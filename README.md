Everything needed is done!

There is no "Save" feature, only "Save As...", and the input may not be verified as much as it could be.

One change I still plan to make is to shortcircuit the 1st menu option (Insert a Website) so it will tell you there is no room for a Website after you input the url, instead of having you input all fields for no reason.
