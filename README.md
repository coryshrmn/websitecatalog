==============

This branch, Gold, is only for code which is as verified as possible.

This is the code we would use if our presentation was 5 minutes away.



Everything needed is done!

There is no "Save" feature, only "Save As...", and the input may not be verified as much as it could be.

One change I still plan to make is to shortcircuit the 1st menu option (Insert a Website) so it will tell you there is no room for a Website after you input the url, instead of having you input all fields for no reason.


Once Gon's ValidateManager has been sufficiently tested and compiles (with no warnings) and runs (with no memory errors), we can merge that here and use it.
